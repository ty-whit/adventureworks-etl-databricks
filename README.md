# AdventureWorks Databricks Portfolio project
In my quest to learn databricks, I have decided to build up a sample ETL process for the [AdventureWorks Sample Database]([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver17&tabs=ssms). 
I have opted to use the parquet files provided by Michael Olafusi at [olafusimichael/AdventureWorksParquet)](https://github.com/olafusimichael/AdventureWorksParquet) as they are a lot easier to parse and input when compared to the raw CSV. 
Doing so enables me to dive into the Data Engineering aspects much faster, specifically things like the Data Lake, the Data Lakehouse, PySpark, Delta Tables, automation techniques, and dashboarding. 
Eventually, as I understand PySpark more, I might modify these notebooks to use the most recent CSV dataset provided by Microsoft, or a set up a secure database connection (provided I can set one up).
